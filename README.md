Salutations!!!
I am a new developer trying to get my career started in front-end design. I am pleased to introduce my personal website. Here you will find who I am, how to contact me, and all of my favorite works that I would like to share.


# üó£Ô∏è User Story


**GIVEN** I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

**WHEN** I load their portfolio

**THEN** I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

**WHEN** I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

**WHEN** I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

**WHEN** I am presented with the developer's first application

**THEN** that application's image should be larger in size than the others

**WHEN** I click on the images of the applications

**THEN** I am taken to that deployed application

**WHEN** I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

**THEN** I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

My site (GlowingSystem) is built with the following technologies:
