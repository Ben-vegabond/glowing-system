Challenge #2

This is my README 

In this project I have made a working draft of my personal Website. Where I will be continuously uploading project throughout my career. 

I started with a brief introduction of who I am as an individiual in the workdforce and I explain the direction I want to take my career.

Currently I have links to showcase my portfolio. I made it the biggest portion of the site so the user knows where to click. 

Lastly I have places where you can best contact me. It is localed in the footer and on the navigation bar.
